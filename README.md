This tool is designed to interface with Microsoft applications using the win32com.client library, leveraging its COM interface. This tool accomplishes two primary tasks:

Slide Extraction as Images: It reads a PowerPoint (PPTX) file and saves each slide as an image (PNG format). This is achieved by utilizing the win32com.client to control Microsoft PowerPoint and exporting each slide as a separate image file.

Text Extraction and Display in a Word Document: After extracting the text content from each slide (titles and bodies), it then creates a Word document. For each slide, it adds the title (if available), the slide image, and the slide body text into the Word document, effectively creating a comprehensive representation of the PowerPoint content.

To install the necessary library, pywin32, which enables interaction with Microsoft applications through their COM interface, the following command should be used:
pip install pywin32
This script demonstrates a practical use case of Python's interoperability with Microsoft Office applications, allowing manipulation and conversion of content between PowerPoint and Word documents.
